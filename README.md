# 🎬 Framely 🎬
--> made by: Ursache Ana-Maria

## 📝 Details about the project:
Framely is a movie discovery application designed to help users browse, filter, and organize their favorite films. The central idea was to create a sleek, user-friendly interface where movie enthusiasts can explore a database of films, view detailed information through interactive modals, and manage a personalized watchlist.

The application focuses on efficient data handling and a seamless user experience, featuring advanced multi-level sorting and filtering logic to help users find exactly what they are looking for in a visually appealing dark-themed environment.

### Technologies used to make this project: 💻
--> React (Hooks: useState, useEffect): React Router for single-page application navigation.

--> HTML & CSS with Variables & modern Media Queries for responsive design.

--> LocalStorage API for persistent data storage (Watchlist).

### Functionalities: 💻
--> Dynamic Movie Discovery: Browse a collection of movies with real-time data fetching from a JSON database.

--> Sorting: sort movies by Rating (High-Low/Low-High) or Alphabetical order (A-Z/Z-A).

--> Granular Filtering: Filter movies by specific genres and rating brackets (e.g., 9+, 8+, 7+, or Below 7).

--> Personalized Watchlist: Add or remove movies from a custom watchlist that persists even after refreshing the page.

--> Interactive Details Modal: View high-resolution posters and detailed movie metadata using a custom-built modal system with portal support.

--> Responsive Design: A fully adaptive interface optimized for Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile devices using modern CSS range syntax.

### Main containers: 💻
--> Movies Container: The primary workspace featuring the search bar, advanced filter/sort controls, and a responsive grid of movie cards.

--> Watchlist View: A dedicated section for users to manage their saved movies, reusing the core card components for consistency.

--> Modal Portal: An isolated UI layer for focused movie details, ensuring a clean separation from the main application flow.

### Commands for the setup: 💻
--> cloning: git clone https://github.com/ana-maria-ursache/Framely-Application
